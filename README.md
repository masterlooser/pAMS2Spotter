# pAMS2Spotter


CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK ACROSS UPDATES!!! IF THE GAME UPDATES YOU WILL MOST LIKELY CRASH, KEEP THE ORIGINAL dbghelp.dll !!! also doesnt work with beta, since i dont have beta.


How to:

  Download dbghelp.dll from here.
  
  Go to your Steam\steamapps\common\Automobilista 2\x64\ Folder.
  
  Make a Backup of the Original dbghelp.dll (copy it and rename it to something)
  
  Drop the dbghelp.dll from here into the Folder.
  
  
  After your First Launch of the Game, the Program will create a "pAMS2Spotter.txt" in the same Folder, this can be edited to turn on/off (first number), change spotter(second number)(not yet recommanded) or to adjust the Volume of the Spotter(third number)(0 - 100)(u have to restart the game for the changes to take effect!)

Known Issues:

  Calls out random stuff after leaving Pitlane.
  
  Talks while Game is Paused and Cars next to you.
